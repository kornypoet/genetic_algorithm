h2.  The Premise

In this example, we will illustrate the effectiviness of genetic algorithms by simulating a population of chromosomes. Each generation, the chromosomes will be assessed and given a fitness score. The closer a given
chromosome is to a predetermined target, the higher the fitness score. Then, by roulette wheel selection,
2 parent chromosomes will be chosen. Chromosomes with a higher fitness score are more likely to be selected.
These parent chromosomes will produce 2 offspring chromosomes, with each offspring carrying certain combined
traits of their parents, based on a crossover rate. Each offspring may also undergo a genetic mutation, also
based on a fixed rate. This process of roulette wheel selection, crossover, and possible mutation is repeated
until a new generation of chromosomes is created. This population of chromosomes is assessed for fitness and
then the entire process is repeated until a chromosome is produced that matches the predetermined target.
     
h3. Chromosomes

For most testing purposes this string shall be used:

@"1010011011001000111110100010101110"@

Broken up into its constituent genes with corresponding decoded value

@1010 0110 1100 1000 1111 1010 0010 1011 101@
@+    6    *    8    nil  +    2    -    drop@
